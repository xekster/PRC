On both occasions he set British 800-metres records of 1:52.4 and 1:51.8 respectively, the latter also being an Olympic record. Born in Manchester, Douglas Lowe first attended Harrow but moved at the age of 14 to Highgate School, where unusually he was made Head Boy for two years before leaving in July 1921. An all-round school sportsman, he excelled as a middle distance runner, winning the Public Schools' 880 yd (805 m) title in 1920. Later, at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied law, he played football and won the 880 yd (805 m) against Oxford in 1922 and 1923, and both the mile (1609 m) and the quarter-mile (402 m) race against them in 1924. In the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Lowe won the 800 metres gold medal in a new European record time of 1:52.4. He beat the fellow Cambridge runner Henry Stallard, who had been considered the pre-race favourite. Stallard suffered a leg injury and could only finish fourth. Lowe also came fourth in the 1,500 metres in a time of 3:57.0. Lowe was defeated in a famous 880 yards race with Germany's Otto Peltzer at the 1926 AAA Championships. Peltzer won by three yards in a time of 1:51.6 with Lowe (untimed but estimated at 1:52.0) also inside the world record of 1:52.2. Lowe was a British champion in 440 yd (402 m) and 880 yd (805 m) in 1927 and 1928. At the Amsterdam Olympics Lowe won the 800 metres in a personal best performance of 1:51.8, a full second and eight yards ahead of a world class field.

On both occasions he set British 800-metres records of 1:52.4 and 1:51.8 respectively, the latter also being an Olympic record. Born in Manchester, Douglas Lowe first attended Harrow but moved at the age of 14 to Highgate School, where unusually he was made Head Boy for two years before leaving in July 1921. An all-round school sportsman, he excelled as a middle distance runner, winning the Public Schools' 880 yd (805 m) title in 1920. Later, at Pembroke College, Cambridge, where he studied law, he played football and won the 880 yd (805 m) against Oxford in 1922 and 1923, and both the mile (1609 m) and the quarter-mile (402 m) race against them in 1924. In the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Lowe won the 800 metres gold medal in a new European record time of 1:52.4. He beat the fellow Cambridge runner Henry Stallard, who had been considered the pre-race favourite. Stallard suffered a leg injury and could only finish fourth. Lowe also came fourth in the 1,500 metres in a time of 3:57.0. Lowe was defeated in a famous 880 yards race with Germany's Otto Peltzer at the 1926 AAA Championships. Peltzer won by three yards in a time of 1:51.6 with Lowe (untimed but estimated at 1:52.0) also inside the world record of 1:52.2. Lowe was a British champion in 440 yd (402 m) and 880 yd (805 m) in 1927 and 1928. At the Amsterdam Olympics Lowe won the 800 metres in a personal best performance of 1:51.8, a full second and eight yards ahead of a world class field.

Born in Burwood, New South Wales (a suburb of Sydney) as one of six children of Alec Dennis, a policeman who acted as a police prosecutor, Clare and her siblings were taught to swim by their father, himself an amateur swimmer, after their family relocated from Burwood to Clovelly Beach. Dennis' sister Thora developed quickly into a competent competitive swimmer, and joined the Sydney Ladies' Swimming Club and was later selected for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, but was prevented from going on the grounds of being too young to travel alone overseas. Dennis pleaded with her father to let her join, which he agreed to on the condition that she first swim the 33 yards (approximately 30 metres) across Clovelly Bay. She managed this by pushing off the bottom of the ocean, disguising this with extravagant stroking. Her first lesson and race at the club ended in her having to be fished out of the pool after her endurance failed and the bottom of the pool was too deep to push off. Dennis attended Randwick Primary School, where she acquired a reputation for being interested in sport rather than schoolwork. She spent large amounts of time playing cricket against the male students. Dennis initially swam as a freestyler, but converted to breaststroke at the age of 13. At her first New South Wales Championships in 1930, held at the Ramsgate Baths, she was disqualified after drifting out of her unmarked lane. The freestyle race was held four times due to multiple lane crossing. It was later discovered that the taps regulating the water flow had been accidentally left on. This created a current strong enough to push the swimmers towards one another. In the breaststroke event, held later, she set a State record, but was disqualified for a one-handed touch. In 1931 she won her first state and national title in the 220-yard breaststroke. She repeated this in 1933, 1934 and 1935, with the championships not being held in 1932, remaining unbeaten until her retirement in 1936. After her 1931 victory, her father died from a leaking heart valve. Dennis considered retiring, but her mother convinced her to continue. In January 1932, Dennis broke the 110-yard Australian record and then the 200-metre world record, gaining automatic selection for the Olympic team at the age of 15. Due to financial difficulties caused by the Great Depression, Dennis managed to attend the Olympics only after assistance was rendered by the Police Department for travel and uniform costs. On arrival, Dennis was hit by illness and then contracted a toe infection after gashing it on the starting platform. Her chances took a boost when Lisa Rocke, who had claimed her 200 m breaststroke world record, was not sent to represent Germany. Dennis won her heat of the 200-metre breaststroke, setting an Olympic record. She narrowly escaped disqualification when a protest was lodged against her \"inappropriate\" costume on the grounds that it exposed too much of her shoulder blade. Dennis changed her swimming style after the heats on the advice of American swimmer Buster Crabbe, who recommended she swim three strokes underwater after her starting dive before surfacing. Using her new technique, she touched in first place at every turn to claim the gold medal, 0.1 of a second faster than Japan's Hideko Maehata, improving on her previous Olympic record. In 1933, Dennis beat her own Australian 220-yard breaststroke record, and in 1934 she captured gold in the 220-yard breaststroke at the 1934 British Empire Games in London.

Born in Burwood, New South Wales (a suburb of Sydney) as one of six children of Alec Dennis, a policeman who acted as a police prosecutor, Clare and her siblings were taught to swim by their father, himself an amateur swimmer, after their family relocated from Burwood to Clovelly Beach. Dennis' sister Thora developed quickly into a competent competitive swimmer, and joined the Sydney Ladies' Swimming Club and was later selected for the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, but was prevented from going on the grounds of being too young to travel alone overseas. Dennis pleaded with her father to let her join, which he agreed to on the condition that she first swim the 33 yards (approximately 30 metres) across Clovelly Bay. She managed this by pushing off the bottom of the ocean, disguising this with extravagant stroking. Her first lesson and race at the club ended in her having to be fished out of the pool after her endurance failed and the bottom of the pool was too deep to push off. Dennis attended Randwick Primary School, where she acquired a reputation for being interested in sport rather than schoolwork. She spent large amounts of time playing cricket against the male students. Dennis initially swam as a freestyler, but converted to breaststroke at the age of 13. At her first New South Wales Championships in 1930, held at the Ramsgate Baths, she was disqualified after drifting out of her unmarked lane. The freestyle race was held four times due to multiple lane crossing. It was later discovered that the taps regulating the water flow had been accidentally left on. This created a current strong enough to push the swimmers towards one another. In the breaststroke event, held later, she set a State record, but was disqualified for a one-handed touch. In 1931 she won her first state and national title in the 220-yard breaststroke. She repeated this in 1933, 1934 and 1935, with the championships not being held in 1932, remaining unbeaten until her retirement in 1936. After her 1931 victory, her father died from a leaking heart valve. Dennis considered retiring, but her mother convinced her to continue. In January 1932, Dennis broke the 110-yard Australian record and then the 200-metre world record, gaining automatic selection for the Olympic team at the age of 15. Due to financial difficulties caused by the Great Depression, Dennis managed to attend the Olympics only after assistance was rendered by the Police Department for travel and uniform costs. On arrival, Dennis was hit by illness and then contracted a toe infection after gashing it on the starting platform. Her chances took a boost when Lisa Rocke, who had claimed her 200 m breaststroke world record, was not sent to represent Germany. Dennis won her heat of the 200-metre breaststroke, setting an Olympic record. She narrowly escaped disqualification when a protest was lodged against her \"inappropriate\" costume on the grounds that it exposed too much of her shoulder blade. Dennis changed her swimming style after the heats on the advice of American swimmer Buster Crabbe, who recommended she swim three strokes underwater after her starting dive before surfacing. Using her new technique, she touched in first place at every turn to claim the gold medal, 0.1 of a second faster than Japan's Hideko Maehata, improving on her previous Olympic record. In 1933, Dennis beat her own Australian 220-yard breaststroke record, and in 1934 she captured gold in the 220-yard breaststroke at the 1934 British Empire Games in London. Though she successfully defended her national title in 1935, she was controversially omitted from the team for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, and subsequently retired." }},

At that time, his training was only 2000 metres daily.

In 1949, a Japanese team (the 'Flying Fish') toured Brazil, and competed in Mar\u00EDlia with excellent results, including victories over the Americans. Okamoto was fascinated with these swimmers and received the following advice: \"if you want to have good results, you must train a lot more: 10,000 metres daily\". Thus, his training changed drastically. Although the pool was unheated and he did not have goggles, Okamoto faced the cold and came out with eyes stinging with the chlorine, but carried out this routine. At the Brazilian Championship in 1950, he became champion for the first time, and his popularity and recognition began to grow. In January 1951, he became the South American record holder for the first time. He swam the 1500-metre freestyle in 19:24.3, breaking the Brazilian record by 40 seconds and the South American record by 13 seconds.

In the 1500-metre freestyle, he broke his own South American record. When he returned from Buenos Aires to Brazil, Okamoto received a big party in his hometown, Mar\u00EDlia. There was a procession in an open car, and awards to the new Brazilian hero. At the same time, however, thieves robbed his house, taking several belongings. Three weeks after the Pan, he broke the South American record for 400-metre freestyle with 4:41.5, which had never before been in the hands of a Brazilian. At the South American Championship in Lima, Peru, in March 1952, Tetsuo won the gold medal in the 400-metre, 800-metre and 1500-metre freestyle. He was a bronze medalist at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki (1500-metre freestyle), the first Brazilian swimmer to win a medal at the Olympics. Tetsuo won his heat with a time of 19:05.6, another new South American record and in the final won the bronze medal with a further South American record of 18:51.3 that would last ten years. After leaving swimming, Okamoto moved to the United States for several years, where he studied geology and business administration and started a company drilling artesian wells.

Okamoto had asthma, and began to swim to treat it at 7 years old. However, it was only when he was 15 years old, and the coach Fausto Alonso arrived to form a serious team in Yara Clube in Mar\u00EDlia, that Tetsuo began to train in a good pool under the guidance of someone with knowledge of swimming. At that time, his training was only 2000 metres daily. By early 1949, aged 17, Tetsuo had climbed several positions in the Brazilian national ranking, and entered the South American Championship in Montevideo, his first international competition. There, he swam the three long distance races, reaching the finals of the 400-metre and 1500-metre freestyle. However, an event at the turn of the decade was a watershed in his swimming career. In 1949, a Japanese team (the 'Flying Fish') toured Brazil, and competed in Mar\u00EDlia with excellent results, including victories over the Americans. Okamoto was fascinated with these swimmers and received the following advice: \"if you want to have good results, you must train a lot more: 10,000 metres daily\". Thus, his training changed drastically. Although the pool was unheated and he did not have goggles, Okamoto faced the cold and came out with eyes stinging with the chlorine, but carried out this routine. At the Brazilian Championship in 1950, he became champion for the first time, and his popularity and recognition began to grow. In January 1951, he became the South American record holder for the first time. He swam the 1500-metre freestyle in 19:24.3, breaking the Brazilian record by 40 seconds and the South American record by 13 seconds. At the inaugural Pan American Games in 1951, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, he claimed two gold medals in the 400-metre and 1500-metre freestyle, and one silver medal in the 4\u00D7200-metre freestyle. In the 1500-metre freestyle, he broke his own South American record. When he returned from Buenos Aires to Brazil, Okamoto received a big party in his hometown, Mar\u00EDlia. There was a procession in an open car, and awards to the new Brazilian hero. At the same time, however, thieves robbed his house, taking several belongings. Three weeks after the Pan, he broke the South American record for 400-metre freestyle with 4:41.5, which had never before been in the hands of a Brazilian. At the South American Championship in Lima, Peru, in March 1952, Tetsuo won the gold medal in the 400-metre, 800-metre and 1500-metre freestyle. He was a bronze medalist at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki (1500-metre freestyle), the first Brazilian swimmer to win a medal at the Olympics. Tetsuo won his heat with a time of 19:05.6, another new South American record and in the final won the bronze medal with a further South American record of 18:51.3 that would last ten years. After leaving swimming, Okamoto moved to the United States for several years, where he studied geology and business administration and started a company drilling artesian wells.

Retired from practicing sports, Gon\u00E7alves Filho became a judo coach, first for Esporte Clube Pinheiros and eventually the Brazilian national team starting in 1978. He advocated weightlifting and extensive training to ensure the Brazilian got physiques matching the Eastern European ones. Gon\u00E7alves attended the Barcelona 1992 and Atlanta 1996, seeing Pinheiros judoka Aur\u00E9lio Miguel win a bronze medal in the latter. Other three Brazilian medallists in Judo, Douglas Vieira, Tiago Camilo, and Leandro Guilheiro, also trained under Gon\u00E7alves. He died in June 2010, of liver failure during a femur surgery. His grandson, Gustavo Guimar\u00E3es, follows his legacy and is part of the current Brazilian water polo team." }},

Vidal was born in Caracas, Venezuela in 1964. At age 20, he became the first Venezuelan swimmer to win an Olympic medal in the 200-meter butterfly competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. Although he was one of the smallest men in the pool at 5-foot-11, Vidal was well ahead of West Germany's 6-foot-7 Michael Gross at the finish. However, one of Gross' elongated arms managed to touch the poolside first, robbing Vidal of silver. That heroic bronze-medal finish made him a national celebrity, with his image splashed on magazine and newspaper covers throughout Venezuela. His mark ranks him as the eighth of the top ten swimmers in the 200-meter butterfly of all time. A year later, Vidal left Venezuela to pursue a career in administration and earned his bachelor's degree in computer and information sciences from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he swam for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition under coach Randy Reese from 1981 to 1985. Vidal was a member of the Gators' NCAA national championship teams in 1983 and 1984, and received six All-American honors. After returning to Venezuela, Vidal was employed by a local television channel as a sports commentator and became a well-known television personality.

Berry was educated at De La Salle College, and represented the school in athletics and rugby league, with moderate success. Berry joined the Pyrmont Club, which trained at Victoria Park Swimming Pool, under Eric Hayes, and swam from 1956 until 1958 as a freestyler, with reasonable age group success. In 1958 he won a butterfly race, and despite winning more races, Hayes did not think that he was suited to butterfly. Berry switched coaches to Don Talbot, training at Bankstown, New South Wales by the end of the year. In 1959, at the under-14 New South Wales Championships, Berry came first, second and third in the breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly respectively. Talbot encouraged him, predicting that he would do well the following year. Berry's parents were surprised when Talbot told them at the end of the year that Berry had a chance of making the 1960 Summer Olympics team for Rome, even though he had never entered an Australian Championship before. At the end of the year, he came second to Neville Hayes, a fellow Talbot swimmer, defeating Harry Turner, who had been expected to be Australia's second butterflier at the Olympics. At the New South Wales championships in January 1960, he came second to Hayes in both the 110-yard and 220-yard butterfly, and repeated this at the Australian Championships, earning himself Olympic selection at the age of 14. He was sent on a training camp with the Australian team to Townsville, Queensland to prepare for the Olympics. Arriving in Rome, Berry swam in the heats of the 4\u00D7100-metre medley relay, before being replaced by Hayes in the final, who combined with David Theile, Terry Gathercole and Geoff Shipton to claim silver behind the United States. Under the rules of the era, heat swimmers were not entitled to medals. In the 200-metre butterfly, Berry qualified fifth fastest, but came home in sixth in the final, six seconds behind the American winner Mike Troy. Hayes finished second. Troy, who was impressed by Berry, sent him an autographed postcard, implying that he could be the next Olympic champion. In 1961 Hayes again won the State and National titles, relegating Berry to second. Berry also finished his high schooling that year, and had a disrupted preparation for an international meet at the end of the year against a Japanese team and the 1962 Commonwealth Games the following year. In the four bilateral meets at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, Berry managed to beat Hayes in the last race, making a psychological breakthrough. At the following New South Wales Championships, he broke both the 220-yard and 110-yard butterfly world records, breaking Hayes' dominance. He again lowered the 220-yard record at the Australian Championships in qualifying for the Commonwealth Games. At the Games in Perth, he set Commonwealth records in both events to record his first international victories, and then combined with Julian Carroll, Ian O'Brien and David Dickson to add a third gold in the 4x110-yard medley relay. In 1963, Berry successfully defended both of his butterfly titles, and then made a European tour with the Australian team, and then successfully passed entry examinations to Indiana University, and moved to the United States on a swimming scholarship under Doc Counsilman. He was defeated in the US Championships that year by Carl Robie, who later captured his world records. Berry trained amongst high calibre swimmers at Indiana, as his teammates included Tom Stock, Chet Jastremski and Ted Stickles, holders of every backstroke, breaststroke and medley world record respectively. In 1964, Berry returned to Australia to qualify for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, breaking world records in both the 100-metre and 200-metre butterfly. Due to financial difficulties, he took a job as a petrol station attendant, and washing dishes for a steakhouse. In one case, the Australian team were hosted for a reception at the steakhouse meaning that he had to prepare and clean up despite being one of the guests. Berry attended a training camp in Ayr, Queensland under Talbot, who was the national head coach. During the week before the 200-metre event in Tokyo, Berry, the favourite for the gold medal, swam an extremely slow time trial during practice, in the view of opposition swimmers, leaving doubts in Talbot's mind. Robie broke the Olympic record in both the heat and semifinal. In the final, Berry was one of only two swimmers to have had previous Olympic experience and decided to deliberately false start in order to unsettle his opponents. He then set a time of 2:06.6, 0.3 of a second faster than his previous world record to claim gold. He later combined with Dickson, O'Brien and Peter Reynolds to claim bronze in the 4\u00D7100-metre medley relay. Berry returned to the United States, but was unable to match his previous form, and exchanged regular wins and defeats with Robie, who swam for the University of Michigan. He was selected for the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, but withdrew after his father's death and returned to Australia. He retired the following year and married, but continued his university education, initially studying business, but later switching to radio and television, and then photography. He worked as a photographer for two years in the United States before switching to the Sydney Morning Herald in Australia, where he later became the Pictorial Editor. He served as the ABC head of sport from 1985 until 1987, before starting his own private sports business. He was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an \"Honor Swimmer\" in 1980." }},

He set twelve world records in his career. After his swimming career ended, he became the Pictorial Editor of the Sydney Morning Herald and later the head of ABC Sport. Berry, the second of seven children, was born in Sydney and grew up in the western suburb of Marrickville, in a family with no prior sporting background. His father Frederick had arrived in Australia in the 1920s and had worked as a bar manager to support the family. He was taught to swim by his elder sister Colleen along with his younger siblings at Botany Bay. His younger brother Paul was a promising youth swimmer who defeated dual Olympic gold medallist Michael Wenden, and later became a professional rugby league player. Berry was educated at De La Salle College, and represented the school in athletics and rugby league, with moderate success. Berry joined the Pyrmont Club, which trained at Victoria Park Swimming Pool, under Eric Hayes, and swam from 1956 until 1958 as a freestyler, with reasonable age group success. In 1958 he won a butterfly race, and despite winning more races, Hayes did not think that he was suited to butterfly. Berry switched coaches to Don Talbot, training at Bankstown, New South Wales by the end of the year. In 1959, at the under-14 New South Wales Championships, Berry came first, second and third in the breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly respectively. Talbot encouraged him, predicting that he would do well the following year. Berry's parents were surprised when Talbot told them at the end of the year that Berry had a chance of making the 1960 Summer Olympics team for Rome, even though he had never entered an Australian Championship before. At the end of the year, he came second to Neville Hayes, a fellow Talbot swimmer, defeating Harry Turner, who had been expected to be Australia's second butterflier at the Olympics. At the New South Wales championships in January 1960, he came second to Hayes in both the 110-yard and 220-yard butterfly, and repeated this at the Australian Championships, earning himself Olympic selection at the age of 14. He was sent on a training camp with the Australian team to Townsville, Queensland to prepare for the Olympics. Arriving in Rome, Berry swam in the heats of the 4\u00D7100-metre medley relay, before being replaced by Hayes in the final, who combined with David Theile, Terry Gathercole and Geoff Shipton to claim silver behind the United States. Under the rules of the era, heat swimmers were not entitled to medals. In the 200-metre butterfly, Berry qualified fifth fastest, but came home in sixth in the final, six seconds behind the American winner Mike Troy. Hayes finished second. Troy, who was impressed by Berry, sent him an autographed postcard, implying that he could be the next Olympic champion. In 1961 Hayes again won the State and National titles, relegating Berry to second. Berry also finished his high schooling that year, and had a disrupted preparation for an international meet at the end of the year against a Japanese team and the 1962 Commonwealth Games the following year. In the four bilateral meets at Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, Berry managed to beat Hayes in the last race, making a psychological breakthrough. At the following New South Wales Championships, he broke both the 220-yard and 110-yard butterfly world records, breaking Hayes' dominance. He again lowered the 220-yard record at the Australian Championships in qualifying for the Commonwealth Games. At the Games in Perth, he set Commonwealth records in both events to record his first international victories, and then combined with Julian Carroll, Ian O'Brien and David Dickson to add a third gold in the 4x110-yard medley relay. In 1963, Berry successfully defended both of his butterfly titles, and then made a European tour with the Australian team, and then successfully passed entry examinations to Indiana University, and moved to the United States on a swimming scholarship under Doc Counsilman. He was defeated in the US Championships that year by Carl Robie, who later captured his world records. Berry trained amongst high calibre swimmers at Indiana, as his teammates included Tom Stock, Chet Jastremski and Ted Stickles, holders of every backstroke, breaststroke and medley world record respectively. In 1964, Berry returned to Australia to qualify for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, breaking world records in both the 100-metre and 200-metre butterfly. Due to financial difficulties, he took a job as a petrol station attendant, and washing dishes for a steakhouse. In one case, the Australian team were hosted for a reception at the steakhouse meaning that he had to prepare and clean up despite being one of the guests. Berry attended a training camp in Ayr, Queensland under Talbot, who was the national head coach. During the week before the 200-metre event in Tokyo, Berry, the favourite for the gold medal, swam an extremely slow time trial during practice, in the view of opposition swimmers, leaving doubts in Talbot's mind. Robie broke the Olympic record in both the heat and semifinal. In the final, Berry was one of only two swimmers to have had previous Olympic experience and decided to deliberately false start in order to unsettle his opponents. He then set a time of 2:06.6, 0.3 of a second faster than his previous world record to claim gold. He later combined with Dickson, O'Brien and Peter Reynolds to claim bronze in the 4\u00D7100-metre medley relay. Berry returned to the United States, but was unable to match his previous form, and exchanged regular wins and defeats with Robie, who swam for the University of Michigan. He was selected for the 1966 Commonwealth Games in Kingston, Jamaica, but withdrew after his father's death and returned to Australia. He retired the following year and married, but continued his university education, initially studying business, but later switching to radio and television, and then photography. He worked as a photographer for two years in the United States before switching to the Sydney Morning Herald in Australia, where he later became the Pictorial Editor.

In 1927, he moved with his family to Itanha\u00E9m. The family wanted to invest in the cultivation and marketing of bananas, for the land and climate are extremely favorable for this. In 1930 Harry's mother, Lois Forssell, built the municipality's first factory making banana products.

He started swimming in 1983 at the age of 6 years old at Sporting Clube de Portugal. In 1987 he left Sporting Clube de Portugal and moved to the club where he remained until the end of his swimming career: Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo. He made the regular route through the sport young age groups, participating in all its most important national competitions, achieving along the way important marks and places that enabled him to get his first participations in international competitions of the respective age groups, namely the Multinations. It was however in 1993 that he emerged at the highest level by winning a place on the national team that represented Portugal in Latin Cup held in Florence, as a result of his performance in the National Championships, held in Alg\u00E9s in March, in the pool of Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo. He achieved in this short course competition the marks of 16:12,58 minutes in the 1500 meters freestyle, and 8:32,97 minutes in the 800 meters freestyle (on the way to the 1500 meters, the 800 meters at the time were still exclusively a women\u2019s event). These marks would give him G1 age group national title (16 years old) and the 2nd place in all age groups, both marks would become later G1 national records, when the redefinition of the age groups occurred by the Portuguese Swimming Federation. In that same season, in the Clube Futebol os Belenenses Olympic sized swimming pool, he would become for the first time national champion in all age groups in the 1500 meters freestyle, with the mark of 16:29,17 minutes. This mark along with the 08:43,32 minutes at the 800 meters freestyle (again on the way to the 1500 meters) would become later as well national records of the G1 age group. In 1994 in the winter Portuguese National Championships (short course), in Braga, he would break the 400 meters freestyle Junior national record with 4:04,14 minutes. In that same year, he would also become the national club record holder of the 4x200 meters freestyle in long course with the mark of 7:49,00 (in Restelo). Record that he would break later in 1996 with 7:44,93 (in Famalic\u00E3o), and again in 1998 with 7:40,81 (in Lisboa), this last one lasted for many years before another team was able to break it. In 1999 with the Portuguese National Team in the international Latin Cup competition, he would also break the record at this event (there are two different records in relays, the marks done by a sports club team and by the National Team). He was as well the short course national club record holder in this event in 1996 with 7:30,78  (in Felgueiras). In 1999 he broke the national club record in the 4x100 meters freestyle with 3:29,35 (in Lisboa). Team wise he was the winner, with his club Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo, of the Portuguese National Championships in 1992 (in Aveiro) and 1993 (in Restelo), in the old score system. Already in the current system, he was the winner of 6 Portuguese National Championships in 7 years: 1995/Olivais, 1996/Restelo, 1997/Restelo, 1998/EUL, 2000/Jamor e 2001/P\u00F3voa Varzim. His contribution for the team and titles was crucial since he was one of the top Portuguese long distance freestyle swimmers. Internationally he took part, in 1994, in what at the time was maybe the most important and emblematic junior competition in the world, at least certainly for a European swimmer: the European Junior Swimming Championships. He swam the 200 meters freestyle (37th place with 2:00.60), the 400 meters freestyle (15th place in the morning heats with 4:07.02, and 7th in the Final B with 4:10,91), the 400 meters medley (16th in the heats with 4:46.07, and 4th in the Final B with 4:41.73), and anchored the 4x200 meters freestyle relay (14th with 8:08.88).

All these times were achieved between 1996 and 1999, well before the high-tech fabric swimsuits era that revolutionized swimming years after. In his trophy gallery, one can also find Cristina Chaves award in 1997. This is the highest swimming award given by Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo, as recognition of the contribution given to the club. One of the less known and most curios episodes of his sports career was when he participated in a swimming event in the United States of America. The event called Turning of the Tides, a beneficence event to MS that was held in September 2001, just a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

Nuno Dias was on the second leg of the Portuguese relay, still in the early stages of the distance, when suddenly an intense fog come across the area and as a result the support boat lost sight of him and the canoeist that was beside him, and the same thing end up happening also with other countries relays. With panic established within the event organization, the National Guard was called to help find the missing athletes in the Pacific Ocean\u2026 Nuno Dias and the canoeist were later found and safely collected by the American support boat. After retiring from competitive swimming, he still had some participations in triathlons and open water competitions. He won the river Tejo crossing competition in one of the first editions of the event recent era. He also completed the Seville marathon, already in 2012, under the three-hour mark with the time of 2h57m. He was member of Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo directive structure in 2004, and around that time started also to teach and coach the younger swimming group ages at the club. He would start working for the Portuguese Swimming Federation one year later in 2005, where among other jobs he was responsible for the master\u2019s national program and later become the Open Water National Coach, responsibility that took him to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, where he coached two Portuguese swimmers during the event: Arseniy Lavrentyev e Daniela In\u00E1cio. Known as the speaker of many Portuguese swimming and triathlons competitions, as well as some athletics ones, he was also the speaker of some international triathlons and open water events, like the Eilat European Triathlon competition in April 2012, and the World Championships Triathlon Series Madrid in 2012 and 2013. The collaboration he had in these and other events with the Portuguese Triathlon Federation end up in the invitation for him to take the job as the Federation General Manager in March 2014, which he accepted.

In his trophy gallery, one can also find Cristina Chaves award in 1997. This is the highest swimming award given by Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo, as recognition of the contribution given to the club. One of the less known and most curios episodes of his sports career was when he participated in a swimming event in the United States of America. The event called Turning of the Tides, a beneficence event to MS that was held in September 2001, just a few weeks after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. An Open Water competition that consisted in a 35 kilometers swimming relay, with one-hour legs, between Santa Catalina Island and Santa Monica shore. Nuno Dias was on the second leg of the Portuguese relay, still in the early stages of the distance, when suddenly an intense fog come across the area and as a result the support boat lost sight of him and the canoeist that was beside him, and the same thing end up happening also with other countries relays. With panic established within the event organization, the National Guard was called to help find the missing athletes in the Pacific Ocean\u2026 Nuno Dias and the canoeist were later found and safely collected by the American support boat. After retiring from competitive swimming, he still had some participations in triathlons and open water competitions. He won the river Tejo crossing competition in one of the first editions of the event recent era. He also completed the Seville marathon, already in 2012, under the three-hour mark with the time of 2h57m. He was member of Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo directive structure in 2004, and around that time started also to teach and coach the younger swimming group ages at the club. He would start working for the Portuguese Swimming Federation one year later in 2005, where among other jobs he was responsible for the master\u2019s national program and later become the Open Water National Coach, responsibility that took him to the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, where he coached two Portuguese swimmers during the event: Arseniy Lavrentyev e Daniela In\u00E1cio. Known as the speaker of many Portuguese swimming and triathlons competitions, as well as some athletics ones, he was also the speaker of some international triathlons and open water events, like the Eilat European Triathlon competition in April 2012, and the World Championships Triathlon Series Madrid in 2012 and 2013. The collaboration he had in these and other events with the Portuguese Triathlon Federation end up in the invitation for him to take the job as the Federation General Manager in March 2014, which he accepted. He was also for several years the swimming commentator and analyst of SportTv, a TV Portuguese sport channel. His second to none determination, strong mind and single minded focus, that kindly gave him the nickname of \u201Canimal\u201D by his colleagues and adversaries, produced during his career swimming efforts and performances that remained in the memory of those who witnessed them. He died on October 7, 2014 in Carnaxide. The Portuguese Swimming and Triathlon Federations organized together a 1500 meters Open Water event in his honor. At the Sport Alg\u00E9s e Dafundo pool was organized a meeting of several friends and swimming contemporaries of him, that in his honor swam for 15 minutes and 53 seconds in relay fashion, his best mark at the 1500 meters freestyle; among them were the Portuguese Olympic swimmers Ricardo Pedroso, Miguel Arrobas, Nuno Laurentino, and Ant\u00F3nio Bessone Bastos.

He immigrated to the United States and held several national swimming titles there. Spence was born in Christianburg, British Guiana, the oldest of eight children\u2014four brothers and four sisters. His father was Scottish and worked as a big game hunter and guide, while his mother was Indian. The Spences would swim in the Demerara River; six family members bore scars from piranha bites suffered while swimming there. Walter and two of his younger brothers, Wallace and Leonard, became champion swimmers. Two of the four Spence sisters also swam competitively, although not at the level of their brothers. The youngest Spence brother, Harold, showed great promise but was killed in action in World War II before his swimming career could take off. After becoming the top swimmer in British Guiana, Walter Spence moved to Trinidad and began competing there. After losing a freestyle race to a swimmer from Chicago, his first-ever loss in that type of competition, Spence decided to pursue training in the United States. He arrived in the United States in 1923, and would eventually gain U.S. citizenship. He began his U.S. career with the Brooklyn YMCA team, swimming the breaststroke and three-stroke individual medley. By 1925 he had broken ten world records and was the top point scorer at the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) national championships that year. He later competed with the Penn Athletic Club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He competed for Canada in the 1928 Olympics and won a bronze medal in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay event. He was also sixth in the 100-metre freestyle event and sixth in the 200-metre breaststroke event. Four years later he was fourth in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay event. He was also fourth in his semifinal of the 100-metre freestyle event and fourth in his semifinal of the 200-metre breaststroke event and did not advance in both occasions. He later represented British Guiana at the 1938 British Empire Games. He won the silver medal in the 220-yard breaststroke contest and finished fourth in the 110-yard freestyle competition. In 1930, Spence enrolled as a freshman at Rutgers University. He set the collegiate record in the 100 yard freestyle and earned the highest point score at the 1934 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships. In 1934 he also broke the world record in the 300-yard three-stroke individual medley. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in journalism on June 9, 1934. After leaving Rutgers, Spence swam with the New York Athletic Club (NYAC). His two younger brothers, Wallace and Leonard, joined him in the United States in 1926 and 1928, respectively. The brothers competed for the NYAC in the three-stroke medley relay, with Wallace swimming the backstroke, Leonard the breaststroke, and Walter the front crawl. Together, they won the 1933 AAU championship title in the event and later set the world record during an exhibition at Rutgers. Joining with Peter Fick, they won the four-man 400 yard freestyle relay at the 1935 AAU championships. After retiring from swimming, Spence worked as an insurance salesman for the Security Mutual Life Insurance Company in New York City. He married Sheila O'Connor and had five children: David (born c. 1942), Harold (born c. 1947), Donald (born c. 1950), Sheila (born c. 1952), and Wendy (born c. 1953). Spence was killed in an accident on October 16, 1958 in White Plains, New York, while trying to board a train at the North White Plains station. He was on his way from New York City to his home in Hawthorne and had stepped off the train to call his wife during a stop at White Plains. When the train began to debark, he ran to catch it and attempted to re-board, but slipped and fell onto the tracks. He suffered severe injuries to his legs and died at White Plains Hospital an hour and a half later. Nine years after his death, in 1967, Walter, Wallace, and Leonard Spence were inducted together into the International Swimming Hall of Fame." }},

He immigrated to the United States and held several national swimming titles there. Spence was born in Christianburg, British Guiana, the oldest of eight children\u2014four brothers and four sisters. His father was Scottish and worked as a big game hunter and guide, while his mother was Indian. The Spences would swim in the Demerara River; six family members bore scars from piranha bites suffered while swimming there. Walter and two of his younger brothers, Wallace and Leonard, became champion swimmers. Two of the four Spence sisters also swam competitively, although not at the level of their brothers. The youngest Spence brother, Harold, showed great promise but was killed in action in World War II before his swimming career could take off. After becoming the top swimmer in British Guiana, Walter Spence moved to Trinidad and began competing there. After losing a freestyle race to a swimmer from Chicago, his first-ever loss in that type of competition, Spence decided to pursue training in the United States. He arrived in the United States in 1923, and would eventually gain U.S. citizenship. He began his U.S. career with the Brooklyn YMCA team, swimming the breaststroke and three-stroke individual medley. By 1925 he had broken ten world records and was the top point scorer at the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) national championships that year. He later competed with the Penn Athletic Club in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He competed for Canada in the 1928 Olympics and won a bronze medal in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay event. He was also sixth in the 100-metre freestyle event and sixth in the 200-metre breaststroke event. Four years later he was fourth in the 4x200-metre freestyle relay event. He was also fourth in his semifinal of the 100-metre freestyle event and fourth in his semifinal of the 200-metre breaststroke event and did not advance in both occasions. He later represented British Guiana at the 1938 British Empire Games. He won the silver medal in the 220-yard breaststroke contest and finished fourth in the 110-yard freestyle competition. In 1930, Spence enrolled as a freshman at Rutgers University. He set the collegiate record in the 100 yard freestyle and earned the highest point score at the 1934 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) championships. In 1934 he also broke the world record in the 300-yard three-stroke individual medley. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in journalism on June 9, 1934. After leaving Rutgers, Spence swam with the New York Athletic Club (NYAC). His two younger brothers, Wallace and Leonard, joined him in the United States in 1926 and 1928, respectively. The brothers competed for the NYAC in the three-stroke medley relay, with Wallace swimming the backstroke, Leonard the breaststroke, and Walter the front crawl. Together, they won the 1933 AAU championship title in the event and later set the world record during an exhibition at Rutgers. Joining with Peter Fick, they won the four-man 400 yard freestyle relay at the 1935 AAU championships. After retiring from swimming, Spence worked as an insurance salesman for the Security Mutual Life Insurance Company in New York City. He married Sheila O'Connor and had five children: David (born c. 1942), Harold (born c. 1947), Donald (born c. 1950), Sheila (born c. 1952), and Wendy (born c. 1953). Spence was killed in an accident on October 16, 1958 in White Plains, New York, while trying to board a train at the North White Plains station. He was on his way from New York City to his home in Hawthorne and had stepped off the train to call his wife during a stop at White Plains.

Born in Brighton-Le-Sands, Sydney, Chapman first came to prominence in the 1952 Australian Championships, at the age of 14, when he cut 2.9 seconds off the 440-yard freestyle Australian record. In 1954, he sliced 12.8 seconds off the 880-yard record in qualifying for the Australian team at the 1954 Empire Games in Vancouver, where he won gold in the 440-yard freestyle and bronze in the 1650-yard freestyle. He also claimed gold in the 4\u00D7220-yard freestyle relay. In his era, the 220 and 880-yard freestyle were not contested as individual events.

Under the rules of the time, heat swimmers were not entitled to gold medals.

Prior to the games, he defeated team-mate Jon Henricks twice in the 220-yard freestyle, setting a world record on one of those occasions. Due to the 200-metre freestyle not being an Olympic event, Chapman was forced to concentrate on the 100-metre freestyle. He won the bronze medal in 100-metre freestyle, finishing behind Henricks and another Australian, John Devitt. As the 220-yard freestyle world record, Chapman was snubbed by the selectors in the 4\u00D7200-metre freestyle relay, only swimming in the qualifying heats, but being replaced by Kevin O'Halloran in the final, where the Australians won the gold medal in a world record time. Under the rules of the time, heat swimmers were not entitled to gold medals. Chapman continued in the sport despite this until the 1958 Empire Games in Cardiff, where he was edged out for gold in the 110-yard freestyle by Devitt, and managed to come only fifth in the 440-yard freestyle behind fellow Australian John Konrads. Chapman collected gold medals in the 4\u00D7220-yard freestyle and 4\u00D7110-yard medley relays. Chapman retired after the 1958 Games. In 1978 he and a friend died after a boat belonging to him capsized near Little Bay, New South Wales, in the south of Sydney. Their bodies were never recovered." }},

Perry (January 6, 1908 \u2013 November 22, 1987) was an American swimmer, attraction promoter, educator and swimming coach. Perry was born in Valdosta, Georgia in 1908. After living in Tampa for several years, he and his family moved to the Ocala, Florida area in 1922. His father was a railroad conductor, and Ocala represented the midpoint of his train route. Perry was happy to discover that he could swim in the clean, clear water at Silver Springs, and he would walk the six miles from Ocala to the springs. In order to earn pocket change, he started teaching local residents to swim for twenty-five cents per lesson. In 1924, Perry became Ocala High School's swim coach and star swimmer; he was only 16 years old at the time. He once swam 25 miles in seven hours, 28 minutes. Perry attended the University of Florida in nearby Gainesville, and was a member of the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in 1933 and 1934. He graduated from the university with a bachelor's degree in education, and later returned to complete a master's degree in education in 1958. Perry learned all he could about swimming, diving and life-guarding. When the American Red Cross published their aquatics safety manual during the 1920s, they selected Silver Springs to shoot the underwater photographs for their manuals. Perry served as the model in many of the Red Cross manual photographs. Silver Springs in the 1920s and 1930s was not that well known and the attraction owners, Carl G. Ray, Sr. and W. M. \"Shorty\" Davidson, would invite journalists from all over the country to come visit their attraction. Perry and his sisters would put on swimming exhibitions both the water's surface and under it. Some of those snapshots would appear in newspapers in Atlanta, Washington, D.C., New York, Jacksonville, Tampa, and other large cities. Life magazine published several articles on Silver Springs and the Perry family. Ray and Davidson invited American sportswriter and short movie producer, Grantland Rice, to vacation in the Ocala area and to be their guest on a tour of Silver Springs. While Rice was visiting the springs, he witnessed the aquatic abilities of Perry and was interested in what he saw. Rice set up his motion picture cameras to record the interesting footage of the swimmer both on the surface and under the surface of the water. Perry demonstrated his powerful freestyle up stream and then dove underwater to perform swimming backwards, somersaults, eating a banana, drinking a soda and other unusual underwater skills. He had stayed underwater for three minutes and 45 seconds. Over the next thirty years, Perry helped produce over 150 of Grantland Rice's \"Sportlight\" series short films. These films were human interest stories about fifteen minutes in length, which were shown before the featured movies at theaters across the country. The subjects included different themes like picnics, weddings, school rooms, track meets, night clubs with bands, and bartenders among other story lines. Rice once did a reel called \"The Human Fish\" featuring Perry, and proclaimed him as the \"best swimmer in America.\" Perry became a go-to consultant for Hollywood movies that involved on-location water scenes, and Florida's crystal-clear spring waters provided nearly ideal underwater filming locations. He played a significant role in the production of MGM's Tarzan Finds a Son! (1939) at Silver Springs and Tarzan's Secret Treasure (1941) at Wakulla Springs through his relationship with actor-swimmer Johnny Weismuller who played Tarzan. He also influenced Universal Studio's decision to film the Creature from the Black Lagoon and its sequels at Wakulla Springs and Silver Springs, as well as the hiring of Florida swimmer Ricou Browning to play the Creature in the movie's underwater sequences. He worked with several noted actors including Weissmuller, W.C. Fields, Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, Gregory Peck, Jayne Mansfield, Ann Blyth, Lloyd Bridges. In 1948, Perry spearheaded the development of the Weeki Wachee Springs attraction, and is credited with performing the first underwater shows there. His daughter Margaret Eileen Perry performed as one of the youngest mermaids ever at the springs in 1948 at age 13. It was later that year that Perry met his future wife Dot. Perry was president of the Florida Attraction Association and attending a convention at Miami Beach. Dot was training for the 1948 U.S. Olympic diving team in one-meter and tower diving. A mutual friend and former Olympic diver, Kathryn Rawls, introduced the two. An instant connection began when Perry climbed to the top of a 10-meter diving platform and started diving, dive for dive, with Dot. Dot found that Perry could do almost anything in the water and that led to a year-long, long-distance romance. Dot had signed with the \"Water Follies,\" a local synchronized swimming act, after failing to qualify for the Olympic diving team. She toured Cuba, Mexico, Central and South America as their star diver. After Perry and Dot's wedding in the fall of 1950, they moved to San Marcos, Texas to develop Aquerena Springs, an underwater attraction similar to Weeki Wachee. After completing the development of Aquarena, Perry and his wife returned to Ocala. They founded an instructional swimming school in Ocala that remains in operation today. Perry's most successful swimming student was his nephew, Don Schollander, a five-time Olympic gold medalist at the 1964 and 1968 Summer Olympics. Perry suffered strokes in 1975 and 1978 that left him partially paralyzed. He was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 1981. He died in Ocala in 1987; he was 79 years old. He was survived by his son, two daughters, and six grandchildren." }},

She was the bronze medalist for springboard diving at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Fauntz was born in New Orleans, and raised in Chicago, where she attended Hyde Park Academy High School. Unable to compete in high school swimming competitions because of a ban on female interscholastic athletics in Illinois, Fauntz competed as a teenager for the Illinois Women's Athletic Club swimming and diving teams. In March 1928 she set new world records for the 100-yard breaststroke (1:20.3) and 100-meter breaststroke (1:29.3) at a dual meet against a Canadian team. About six months before that she was hit by a car and severely injured the radial nerve in her right arm. At the age of 17 at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Fauntz finished in fifth place in the women's 200-meter breaststroke. Her specialty, however, was diving. Describing Fauntz during the Olympic diving competition, author Paul Gallico wrote in the New York Daily News: \"..Her marvelous body flowed through the dives with the smoothness of running quicksilver.\" That \"marvelous body\" became a source of mild controversy at the Los Angeles games, when a Hungarian diving judge, Dr. Leo Donath, ordered the diving competition halted until the American divers changed their suits; he had objected to the near-backless cut of the team-supplied swimsuit. At the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) swimming indoor national championships in Chicago in 1929, Fauntz won two national titles within the space of one half-hour, winning the one-meter springboard and 100-meter breaststroke titles. Fauntz captured the three-meter springboard bronze medal at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, finishing 5 points behind gold medalist Georgia Coleman and a single point behind silver medalist Katherine Rawls, helping the United States team to a sweep of the event. Fauntz led the competition after the compulsory dives, but slipped to third after mistiming the entry on her next-to-last optional dive. (Fauntz later said this dive was \"the worst one I'd ever done. There went my world; I didn't even want to come up from the pool.\") Fauntz parlayed her Olympic success to a career in marketing, modeling, and professional aquatic exhibitions. She became one of the first female athletes to appear on the Wheaties cereal box; she was also one of many celebrities of the time recruited to endorse cigarettes (in her case, Camels) and beer (Falstaff). Jane also appeared as cover girl for Life and Ladies Home Journal. She worked as a model for Saks Fifth Avenue. As a professional diver, Fauntz appeared in exhibitions at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, where she met future husband Edgar \"Eggs\" Manske, an All-American football star at Northwestern University; they married in 1936.

She was the bronze medalist for springboard diving at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Fauntz was born in New Orleans, and raised in Chicago, where she attended Hyde Park Academy High School. Unable to compete in high school swimming competitions because of a ban on female interscholastic athletics in Illinois, Fauntz competed as a teenager for the Illinois Women's Athletic Club swimming and diving teams. In March 1928 she set new world records for the 100-yard breaststroke (1:20.3) and 100-meter breaststroke (1:29.3) at a dual meet against a Canadian team. About six months before that she was hit by a car and severely injured the radial nerve in her right arm. At the age of 17 at the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam, Fauntz finished in fifth place in the women's 200-meter breaststroke. Her specialty, however, was diving. Describing Fauntz during the Olympic diving competition, author Paul Gallico wrote in the New York Daily News: \"..Her marvelous body flowed through the dives with the smoothness of running quicksilver.\" That \"marvelous body\" became a source of mild controversy at the Los Angeles games, when a Hungarian diving judge, Dr. Leo Donath, ordered the diving competition halted until the American divers changed their suits; he had objected to the near-backless cut of the team-supplied swimsuit. At the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) swimming indoor national championships in Chicago in 1929, Fauntz won two national titles within the space of one half-hour, winning the one-meter springboard and 100-meter breaststroke titles. Fauntz captured the three-meter springboard bronze medal at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics, finishing 5 points behind gold medalist Georgia Coleman and a single point behind silver medalist Katherine Rawls, helping the United States team to a sweep of the event. Fauntz led the competition after the compulsory dives, but slipped to third after mistiming the entry on her next-to-last optional dive. (Fauntz later said this dive was \"the worst one I'd ever done. There went my world; I didn't even want to come up from the pool.\") Fauntz parlayed her Olympic success to a career in marketing, modeling, and professional aquatic exhibitions. She became one of the first female athletes to appear on the Wheaties cereal box; she was also one of many celebrities of the time recruited to endorse cigarettes (in her case, Camels) and beer (Falstaff). Jane also appeared as cover girl for Life and Ladies Home Journal. She worked as a model for Saks Fifth Avenue. As a professional diver, Fauntz appeared in exhibitions at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, where she met future husband Edgar \"Eggs\" Manske, an All-American football star at Northwestern University; they married in 1936. An artist by training (B.A., art education, University of Illinois) and vocation, Fauntz was a painter and sculptor. While her husband was serving in the United States Navy during World War II, she made ceramic figurines for California Faience in Berkeley, California, and later sold her figurines under the trade name \"Jane Fauntz Original\".
